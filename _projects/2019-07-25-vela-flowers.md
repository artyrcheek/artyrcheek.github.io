description: At BraveTheSkies, I did lots of work on Vela, An internal flower subscription service built by heavily modifying an existing Shopify theme. It contains many advanced customizations including a bespoke integration with recharge and a date-picker which tags orders to make it easier for vela to dispatch their flowers.
