description: This app exists to relieve the pain of printing gift messages and shipping labels, then manually matching them up. It uses template matching by order tags to create a simple way of creating labels. It creates shipping labels through the Royal Mail API, and matches them with their gift message, then exports them as a pdf ready to be printed in bulk by a industrial printer.
