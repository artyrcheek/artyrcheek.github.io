### Whats that?
Jekyll is a static site generator written in ruby. It generates static html pages. The page is presented through several templates and then fires the whole site, were articles are written in a text markup language like Markdown through the liquid converters to generate fully generated compiled website
### Why?
##### Quick development times
Jekyll sites are written with HTML, CSS, Javascript and Liquid the exact same languages I am used to from working with shopify themes. This makes it quick and easy for me to make a site with.
##### Quick loading times
A static site generator takes source files and generates an entirely static website. This means there is no waiting time for a server to render html, which makes it very fast.


> If you are a developer and haven't checked out static site generators I would highly reccomend it they are great!
